Who am I?
===

I entered the United States Army when I was 17 as a 98G Cryptolinguist. I was assigned to the Korean Language and spent the next year and a half learning Korean to a level of functional fluency. I graduated the course and received my degree in Korean Language from the Defense Language Institute. Following language training, one of the most difficult courses I will ever have to take, I began work with the a joint-service team working for the National Security Agency. I was only able to be an intelligence analyst, the original job I enlisted for, for a short while. Shortly after beginning work with the Agency, my aptitude for software development was recognized and I was recruited to be on a software development team to build database-driven web applications for analysts.  

I was in the military for a total of seven years and worked for the National Security Agency for the last 4 and a half years of my term. For my contributions to software development and enhancement to the various missions I was able to work on or for, I was awarded the Joint Service Commendation Medal by the National Security Agency and the Department of Defense.  

Since my work for the government I have held positions doing large dataset cloud analytics using Java frameworks such as Hadoop, Cloudbase and HBase and for the past few years I have focused my career on Ruby on Rails applications and front-end development for javascript heavy applications built to utilize HTML5, CSS3 and modern javascript techniques.  

Aside from all of my professional endeavors, I have a 9-year-old daughter and a wife from Melbourne, Australia. I love learning new things all the time. In the past few years I've applied my logical approach to problems to cooking and I love it. Despite what most people say, I think cooking is easy and just like building a lego set -- follow the directions. I also have a passion for movies. I worked as a writer and editor for TheFilmStage.com and covered film festivals as a film journalist writing film reviews and news. I like to keep my interests varied and unique.

Abstract: The solutions provide a distributed computing architecture and system for HTTP message exchange and modification. An HTTP request for information may be pre-processed by a first server to detect the geographic location information of the requester and add such geographic information into the request. The modified request is further processed by a second server to identify rules associated with each type of geographic location information included in the request and to add such rule information as associated with the geographic location information into the request. The further modified request is then processed by a third server to determine the geographic location information, retrieve the rule information, and map and obtain a content customized for the request based on the geographic location information and the rule information.
