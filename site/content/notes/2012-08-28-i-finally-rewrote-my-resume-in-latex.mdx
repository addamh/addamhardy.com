I had been needing to rewrite my resume for a while. I've always had it in a doc file of course but I wanted to be super nerd-o and update it in LaTeX. And here it is!  
  
It was quite a bitch to work through all this and figure everything out but I found a nice example to work off of and it was fun to finally learn LaTeX. (Which is apparently pronounced /ˈlɑːtɛk/ or if you don't read dictionary, lay-tek). I've published it on Github ([link](https://github.com/addamh/resume)) if you'd like to fork it and write your own resume in LaTeX. The code and resulting compiled PDF are below. Let me know what you think!  
  
The code:  
  
```LaTeX
\documentclass[letterpaper,13pt]{article}

\newlength{\outerbordwidth}

\pagestyle{empty}

\raggedbottom

\raggedright

\usepackage[svgnames]{xcolor}

\usepackage{framed}

\usepackage{tocloft}

%-----------------------------------------------------------

\setlength{\outerbordwidth}{1pt}  % Width of border outside of title bars

\definecolor{shadecolor}{gray}{0.75}  % Outer background color of title bars (0 = black, 1 = white)

\definecolor{shadecolorB}{gray}{0.93}  % Inner background color of title bars

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\vspace{10pt}

Find a secure position in a small team environment passionate about innovation, communication and test driven development, that is focused on results and progress instead of process. Less a “job” and more a group of close friends that work well together and are driven to push each other past their limits.
