I had been needing to rewrite my resume for a while. I've always had it in a doc file of course but I wanted to be super nerd-o and update it in LaTeX. And here it is! <!--more-->
<br /><br />
It was quite a bitch to work through all this and figure everything out but I found a nice example to work off of and it was fun to finally learn LaTeX. (Which is apparently pronounced /ˈlɑːtɛk/ or if you don't read dictionary, lay-tek). I've published it on Github (<a href="https://github.com/addamh/resume">link</a>) if you'd like to fork it and write your own resume in LaTeX. The code and resulting compiled PDF are below. Let me know what you think!

<br /><br />
The code:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/3505810.js?file=resume.tex"></script>
<br /><br />
The compiled result:
<div>
	<img src="/assets/images/resume/resume-1.png">
	<img src="/assets/images/resume/resume-2.png">
</div>
