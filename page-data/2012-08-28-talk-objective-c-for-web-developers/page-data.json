With teaching students you know they don't have any idea what you're talking about but at a tech conference I felt like I might be more harshly judged. But once I started talking it all went smoothly and turned out great! I think I could have put some more time into my talk and it could have been better -- of course I am a master procrastinator. :( But it turned out alright.
