<h1>Bio</h1>
<div class="bio">
	<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I entered the United States Army when I was 17 as a 98G Cryptolinguist. I was assigned to the Korean Language and spent the next year and a half learning Korean to a level of functional fluency. I graduated the course and received my Associates of Arts in Korean Language from the Defense Language Institute.  Following language training, one of the most difficult courses I will ever have to take, I began work with the a joint-service team working for the National Security Agency. I was only able to be an intelligence analyst, the original job I enlisted for, for a short while. Shortly after beginning work with the Agency, my aptitude for software development was recognized and I was recruited to be on a software development team to build database-driven web applications for analysts.<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was in the military for a total of seven years and worked for the National Security Agency for the last 4 and a half years of my term. For my contributions to software development and enhancement to the various missions I was able to work on or for, I was awarded the Joint Service Commendation Medal by the National Security Agency and the Department of Defense.<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since my work for the government I have held positions doing large dataset cloud analytics using Java frameworks such as Hadoop, Cloudbase and HBase and for the past few years I have focused my career on Ruby on Rails applications and front-end development for javascript heavy applications built to utilize HTML5, CSS3 and modern javascript techniques.<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside from all of my professional endeavors, I have a 9-year-old daughter and a wife from Melbourne, Australia. I love learning new things all the time. In the past few years I've applied my logical approach to problems to cooking and I love it. Despite what most people say, I think cooking is easy and just like building a lego set -- follow the directions. I also have a passion for movies. I worked as a writer and editor for TheFilmStage.com and covered film festivals as a film journalist writing film reviews and news. I like to keep my interests varied and unique.<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently I am the Lead Web Developer for <a href='http://datarank.com' target="blank">Datarank</a>. I have recently returned to University to acquire a few more degrees. I am now a full-time father, full-time developer and full time student working towards a double major in Computer Science. I work best when there's too much work to be done.
