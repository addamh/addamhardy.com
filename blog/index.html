       <p>Yesterday I found this <a href="http://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/10/25/on-being-a-senior-engineer/">great post</a> on being a Senior Engineer and one of the best portions, of what was an outstanding albeit very long post that you should also read, was this list of Ten Commandments of Egoless Programming. The writer was making the case that there’s a lot more to being a Senior Engineer than just knowing all of the APIs by memory. He introduces the term “Mature Engineer” rather than Senior Engineer; meaning there are a lot of interpersonal, communication, and intangible skills that you gather only through a long stream of real world experience managing projects and people rather than expertise on a language or codebase.

       <p>We are strong believers in the agile method of software development. We break down key features into user stories, do sprint planning, track velocity, unit and integration testing; all that good stuff. But we’ve had a few key pillars of agile development missing for a while and we recently rectified that.

       <p>Git provides a very valuable feature that many developers seem to either overlook or blatantly not care about; it enables you to add distinct sections to a commit message. Specifically, it allows you to add a short summary for the commit and a long and detailed body.

       <p>You know when your house is really dirty and you avoid having people come over until you get it clean? I often feel the same way when I’m using my machine and I need to show someone something. A lot of the time my desktop is a complete disaster. I go through cycles really. It gets dirtier and dirtier for a few weeks and then once a month or so I do a deep clean and clear it all out. And then restart the process.

       <p>So no shit, there you are, building a web app that is using the Facebook SDK/API. You’ve followed all the integration tutorials. You’ve got all the code in place. You’re ready to go. You fire up the Sidekiq and your Rails server with Foreman, and you finally click on your pretty little Facebook login button. And then…

       <p>It’s been too many months since the last blog. And I really mean to start it up regularly again. Today I finally had a topic that popped up that I could easily write a quick post about and I’m hoping that getting a post out will get the ball rolling and I can get back into the groove of blogging again. Today I needed to have a mobile website have a link to the native app on the iPhone. IF they have it installed. This proved to be a bigger pain in the ass than you’d think.

       <p>Warning: This is a pretty personal post. Staying up too late with too much wine
and too much self doubt led to this existential crisis. Writing blog posts when
you’re alone at 3am after nearly 2 bottles of wine can make you question your life.

       <p>Last week I was able to be a speaker at a local tech conference in Fayetteville, AR, called <a href="http://techfests.com/NWA/2012/default.aspx">TechFest NWA</a>. For the past few years I've had a goal I really wanted to accomplish of being a speaker at a conference and I was finally able to realize that goal. And on iOS to boot! Overall, it was pretty awesome!

       <p>Putting the game face on. And just doing it.

I’ve been on the fence for weeks now…. but I quickly filled out the forms to speak at <a href="http://techfests.com/NWA/2012/">NWA Techfest</a> before I could change my mind!

       <p>Like most of the technology addicted masses, I sleep with my Macbook Pro either on, near or around my bed. I can quickly check emails or IMs that come in or just generally waste my life away and prevent myself from going to sleep, but I can't help it. That's why it's called an addiction. It also allows me to take advantage of some apps while sleeping.

       <p>I've just started the leg of my professional career involving iOS. I've been a registered iOS developer since the iPhone developer program was created and I've been tinkering with things since then, but now I am employed as an iOS developer. I can officially say that my profession is 'iOS Developer'.

       <p>My very first tech blog on my own personal site! We’ll see what comes of this. I have a bit of a problem on focusing on things and sticking to it, but I’m going to do my best to keep a semi-sort-of-regular-kind-of-occasional routine of tech blogs going.
